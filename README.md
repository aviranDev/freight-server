# Freight Data API with Mongoose and TypeScript

## Description

This Node.js application is a REST API built with TypeScript and MongoDB using Mongoose. It is designed to handle freight-related data and provides tools for the frontend to interact with and visualize this data. The API supports different roles, including admin, super admin, and employee, each with specific permissions and capabilities.

## Features

- **TypeScript:** The application is written in TypeScript, providing type safety and enhanced developer experience.
- **Mongoose:** MongoDB is used as the database, and Mongoose is the ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for Node.js and MongoDB, simplifying interactions with the MongoDB database.
- **Express.js:** The app utilizes Express.js as the web application framework for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement role-based access control to manage permissions for admin, super admin, and employee roles.
- **Freight Data Endpoints:** Define and document the RESTful endpoints for handling freight data. Include information about creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data.
- **Admin Tools:** Describe tools or features available for admin and super admin roles to manage users, roles, or other administrative tasks.
